# testcafeJenkins
A Dockerfile that creates a custom Jenkins image for automation testing

You Need
- Docker installed

Then
- Clone the Dockerfile
- Build the image
- Use the image as you whish

I've created this Dockerfile to have the Test Caf√© tool run into this container using Firefox and Chromium 
in headless mode and execute automated UI tests.
